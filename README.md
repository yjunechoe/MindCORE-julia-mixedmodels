# MindCORE workshop: Introduction to mixed-effects models in Julia

Abstract:

> Mixed-effects regression models have been a popular choice of statistical analysis in experimental psychology and linguistics research. While theyâ€™ve historically been developed and taught in R (namely, via the lme4 package), a newer implementation in the Julia programming language called MixedModels.jl has emerged and matured as a successor. The MixedModels.jl Julia library preserves much of the familiar interface from lme4, while offering many advancements in the complexity and speed of fitting mixed-effects models.
